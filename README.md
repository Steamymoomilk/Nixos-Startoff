README.md
so the purpose of this project is to make nixos more beginner freindly, which yes i know it is kinda aginst the nixos philosphy of build it yourself. but i was once a complete noob once so ehh, i remember transitoning to nixos was very hard from other
distros and nixos has a mountain of a learning curve, i watched tons of videos and read manpages which helped alot. but nixos is such a great OS i want begginers to learn it. this is the only distro that hasnt had any compromises.

also this is my first github project so go easy on me, and if i didnt credit someone correctly please let me know. i love open soured and the people behind nixOS thanks!!

So cheers to nix-Startoff
